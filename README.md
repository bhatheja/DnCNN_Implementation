### For this project, we implemented feed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNN), which utilize residual learning and batch normalization to boost denoising performance. We also used patching of 128x128 to augment the dataset.

## Model Architecture
![Architecture](https://github.com/bhatheja/DnCNN_Implementation/blob/main/images/Model_architecure.png)

This Model provides a reasonably good psnr value with high noise even when trained for fewer epochs and large enough patching.
<h3>Results. We had chosen the depth of the network to be 17 which is large enough for capturing the contextual information from the surrounding of the pixel. The receptive field for the implemented network is 35 for our case.</h3>

### Evaluation after masking defect in the clean image and denoised image
#### SSIM for the complete image
![SSIM](https://github.com/bhatheja/DnCNN_Implementation/blob/main/images/SSIM.png)

#### PSNR for the complete image which will generally be very high because the size of the mask is very small

#### PSNR value for only active pixels
