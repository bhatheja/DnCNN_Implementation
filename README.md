### For this project, we implemented feed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNN), which utilize residual learning and batch normalization to boost denoising performance. In addition to that, we used patching of 128x128 to augument dataset.

## Model Architecture
![Architecture](https://github.com/bhatheja/DnCNN_Implementation/blob/main/images/Model_architecure.png)

This Model provides resonably good psnr value with high noise even when trained for less number of epcohs and large enough patching.
<h3>Results. We had choosen the depth of the network to be 17 which is large enough for capturing the contextual information from the surrounding of the pixel. The receptive field for the implemented netword is 35 for out case.</h3>
