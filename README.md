### For this project, we implemented feed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNN), which utilize residual learning and batch normalization to boost denoising performance. In addition to that, we used patching to augument dataset.

## Model Architecture
![Architecture](https://github.com/bhatheja/DnCNN_Implementation/blob/main/images/Model_architecure.png)

With This Model We could get resonably good psnr value with high noise even for less number of epochs
<h3>Results. We had choosen the depth of the network to be 17 which is large enough for capturing the contextual information from the surrounding of the pixel. The receptive field for the implemented netword is 35 for out case.</h3>
